# Weather Dashboard
This is a simple weather dashboard built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and openweather API. </br>

Upon landing, the browser grabs the user's geolocation data to display their current weather and five day forecast. User can search for any city in the world on the search bar to display current weather and five day forecast. Search history is saved on the left side, which the user can then click on to display corresponding weather condition. </br>

Weather information displayed include temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index. The UV index also has a color code to indicate how strong the UV is.  </br>

This app also includes a responsive design that has optimized layout for different devices.  </br>
